    <div id="content">
    <p>My name is Madi Burinsky and I am a junior multiplatform journalism major and a Spanish language, culture and professional contexts minor at the University of Maryland. I am currently a staff writer and editor for Her Campus Maryland, an online collegiate magazine for women. In addition to writing, I am also an intern with The Black Sheep Maryland, which means that I get to create sattircal social media content about the university. This summer I will also be an intern at the Sanpete Messenger in Manti, Utah. When I'm not in class, I can be found at our campus radio station where I cohost a radio show with my roommate. I also enjoy being a mentor for elementary school children through the program America Reads. Some of my favorite activites on campus are the several intramural sports teams that I participate in, like volleyball and soccer. Journalism is great and all, but my true passion in life is cats. </p>
